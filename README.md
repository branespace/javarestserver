# javarestserver

## A simple demonstration REST server in java

javarestserver uses the com.sun.net.HttpServer package to implement a basic REST server.  The resource is deliberately simple, a single 'name' endpoint.  Persistence is not incorporated, and the resource is maintained in a simple arraylist.  It could easiy be adapted to use a database of some variety.  No authentication is included.  This project is intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production system.
